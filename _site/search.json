Our students have skills in R, Python, data management, and various areas of statistics. This is an opportunity for students in our department to exchange data and consulting expertise with Tribal environmental professionals, and to learn more about Tribal communities in the Pacific Northwest and across the country."

    "text": "Expectations\nTogether we will construct and agree to a short contract to summarize the standards for our work together. Here are some draft ideas:\n\nWe are collaborators and this is a mutual learning experience, an exchange. We will provide our skills and time to help Tribes build their capacity and resources, and we will learn skills from Tribal partners, build new relationships, and deepen our understanding of Tribal issues and environmental work.\nFirst and foremost, we are building relationships. We are not arriving, evaluating, deciding how to “help”, taking action, and leaving. Instead of saying “I’m here to help you”, we will ask, “What do you need?”\nWe acknowledge Tribes as sovereign nations that have a government-to-government relationship with the United States. Sovereignty is inherent to Tribes; it is not something we or others can give or take away.\nWe will not be ashamed to say, “I know not,” nor will we fail to call in our colleagues when the skills of another are needed for solving a problem.\nWe will respect the privacy of those who provide any data, for their data are not disclosed to us that the world may know, so we will tread with care in matters of privacy and security.\nWe will remember that data are not just numbers without meaning or context, but represent real people and situations, and that working with data may lead to unintended societal consequences, such as inequality, poverty, and disparities due to algorithmic bias."
